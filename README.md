# CMPM-121-Unity-Scene

### Scene Description:

For my scene, I decided to recreate a childhood bedroom. To capture this theme, I included objects like various toys, childlike furniture,
and other objects that a child would be interested in. I drew inspiration from Andy's room from Disney's Toy Story 1 and even made the
playable character a stuffed bear as an homage to the plot of that film.
